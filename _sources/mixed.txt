Mixed types
===========

PyOP2 supports combining objects of type :class:`~pyop2.Set`,
:class:`~pyop2.DataSet`, :class:`~pyop2.Dat` and :class:`~pyop2.Map` to form
*coupled* or *mixed* types as they are required e.g. in finite-element methods
to solve coupled system of equations. This is the basis for the support of
*mixed spaces* in `Firedrake`_.

Mixed objects are created by passing an *iterable* (a :class:`list`,
:class:`tuple` or a finite generator) of the objects to combine into a mixed
object into the corresponding mixed type constructor. All mixed objects are
iterable, yielding their constituent objects, and support indexing in the
usual Python syntax, with the exception of :class:`~pyop2.Map`, where indexing
creates an indexed :class:`~pyop2.Map`.
